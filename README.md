Data Cleaning
In the data cleaning section of the code, we perform the following tasks:

Check for and display the count of missing values in the dataset.
Fill missing values with zeros and with the mean of their respective columns.
Rename columns for better readability.
Convert date columns to datetime format.
Data Analysis and Visualization
The code then proceeds to analyze and visualize the data:

Create heatmaps to visualize correlations between unemployment rate, employment, and labor participation rate.
Generate histograms to explore the distribution of unemployment rates by region.
Calculate and display the average employment rate by region using a bar chart.
