# Getting Started
  To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly


# Data Cleaning
In the data cleaning section of the code, we perform the following tasks:
 * Check for and display the count of missing values in the dataset.
 * Fill missing values with zeros and with the mean of their respective columns.
 * Rename columns for better readability.
 * Convert date columns to datetime format.

# Data Analysis and Visualization
 The code then proceeds to analyze and visualize the data:
 * Create heatmaps to visualize correlations between unemployment rate, employment, and labor participation rate.
 * Generate histograms to explore the distribution of unemployment rates by region.
 * Calculate and display the average employment rate by region using a bar chart.
